# Hello World!
This is a profile with all of the practise work I have done to learn different languages. So far, I have done:
- A program in C++ that simulates a vending machine, with a fantasy twist to it.
- A list of practise programs for learning OOP using C++.
- Examples of searching algorithms for a OCR A Level course in Computer Science, in the topic of Data Structures and Algorithms.
